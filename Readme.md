## 1. Fundamental Application Components
Understanding of Android's top-level application components (Activity, Service, Broadcast Receiver, Content Provider) and the lifecycle associated with each one. Candidates should be able to describe the types of application logic that would be best suited for each component, and whether that component is executing in the foreground or in the background. This includes strategies for determining how and when to execute background work.

#### 1a. Describe an application's key functional and nonfunctional requirements
A functional requirement describes what a software system should do, while non-functional requirements place constraints on how the system will do so.

** Functional requirement example**
When a user registers, the system should send an email confirming their registration

** Non-functional requirement example**
Registration confirmation email should be sent within 30 seconds of registration
